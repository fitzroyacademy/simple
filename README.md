# WOWZERS, let's do the internet


This is a simple version of putting our things on the internet yet. Code like it's 1997, baby! YEOW!


## Installing:

* Download MAMP: https://www.mamp.info
* Install and run MAMP (not MAMP pro!)
* Set ports to 80 + 3306
* Grab the files from Github with `git clone git@github.com:fitzroyacademy/simple.git`
* Set MAMP's settings to look at the above github directory
* Turn MAMP on!

Now SCSS:

* install npm
* `npm install -g sass`


## Starting work

* Make sure MAMP is running
* open the main folder in terminal
* `sass --watch assets/scss/fit.scss assets/css/fit.css` to make SCSS compile
* `git pull` to get the latest codez
* edit things!


## Sending code to the internet as you work

* `git status` to see what git thinks you've done
* `git add .` to 'add' your changed code
* `git commit -m "your message goes here"` to explain the mess you've made
* `git pull` to get the latest from the server before sending your own
* If you get an error here we'll have to merge! Talk to Will.
* `git push` to send your code to the internets
