## Starting work

* Make sure MAMP is running
* open the main folder in terminal
* `sass --watch style/scss/fit.scss style/css/fit.css` to make SCSS compile

* edit things!


## Sending code to the internet

* `git status` to see what git thinks you've done
* `git add .` to 'add' your changes
* `git commit -m "your message goes here"` to explain the mess you've made
* `git pull` to get the latest from the server
* If you get an error here we'll have to merge! Talk to Will
* `git push` to send your code to the internets
