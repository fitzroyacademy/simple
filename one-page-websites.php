			<ol>
				<li>Start by brainstorming all the possible projects that could be done to achieve your goals.</li>
				<li>Narrow down to find a project that is achievable.</li>
				<li>List all the things that need to be done in order to get the project finished and write them in a series of story cards: As a (user), I need (a thing) so I can (achieve a goal)</li>
				<li>Finally, take a guess at how big each task is relative to the others. Use ‘T-shirt sizing’ to label the tasks Small, Medium and Large.</li>

				<li>Decide on a week's worth of work: what’s important to be finished?</li>
				<li>Move those cards into the ‘doing this week column.’</li>
				<li>For each card, someone puts up their hand to be responsible for making sure this card is completed by the end of the week - the project owner. (NB: this person doesn’t actually have to DO the work, only insure that it’s done.)</li>
				<li>Finally, make sure everyone has a week’s worth of important work to be done.</li>

				<li>First a showcase, people present the work they’ve done this week so everyone can appreciate what was achieved.</li>
				<li>Next, look at the status of all the cards that weren’t completed and find out why.</li>
				<li>Finally, a retrospective, the project manager gives time for each person to share their thoughts from the week about both the work that was done, and the agile process. In turn each person shares:</li>

					<li>Something they’d like to stop doing.</li>
					<li>Something they’d like to start doing.</li>
					<li>And something they’d like to continue doing.</li>
