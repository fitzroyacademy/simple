	<div class="segment segment_lesson" id="lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">1</span> Unique value proposition.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="XInuNhD9pOg"></div>
		<p>Issac groups the 9 boxes of the business model canvas into 3 lenses. We start with thinking about the first lens desirability: What makes your organisation desirable to prospective doners and customers. This first box we table is UVP: What is unique and valuable that your org provides?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">2</span> Customer Segments.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="4K-xWrgjlso"></div>
		<p>Next in the desirability lens is customer segments: What are the groups of people, customers, that are willing to give you money, and what important to them.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">3</span> Customer relationships.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="gkjEoud-CDg"></div>
		<p>The third box within the desirability lens: Customer relationships. Now we have a good idea who our customer is, the question now is 'How do we engage with them?'</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">4</span> Channels.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="t2CXrLsVt7w"></div>
		<p>Finally for the desirability lens: Channels. Which existing channel to customers do you already have, and how can you manage it better?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">5</span> Key resources.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="tp7HHPHD73Q"></div>
		<p>Now we start the second lens: Feasibility. This lens is about the operations of your org and how the magic is made. We start with the box on the canvas 'Key resources': What the main resources you have at your disposal for the org?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson" id="lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">6</span> Key activities.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="PyArNpD_DSA"></div>
		<p>Next for feasability: Key activities. What are the main operations that your org does, day to day?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">7</span> Key partners.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="hBTV5l2qw8Q"></div>
		<p>Finally for feasability: Key partners. Partners are people who take things off our plate, it's important that we make sure to work with partners as our own resources will always be limited.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">8</span> Costs</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="7yP8r80boNE"></div>
		<p>The final lens is Viability: The finances of your organisation. We start with the costs box: What are the main areas of costs for the organisation.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">9</span> Revenue.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="WSvJ09dAksE"></div>
		<p>The final box on the canvas: Revenue. What are the relable and repeatable streams of revenue that you can access for your organisation? How much and how often do people donate?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">10</span> Innovating with your canvs.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="etKdodQjRlM"></div>
		<p>Finally, your canvas is done. Now is the time to step back, go for a walk around the block. Once you've refreshed yourself it's time to put the canvas to work. Issac takes you through a few ways you can use this completed canvas to begin to innovate within your organisation.</p>

	<div class="segment segment_practical">
		<h2><span class="no"><i class="fas fa-flask"></i></span> Social enterprise cafe example canvas.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="E9hhcVgnNoM"></div>
		<p>Issac takes you through a completed canvas start to finish, thinking through how a social enterprise cafe could work using the canvas.</p>
