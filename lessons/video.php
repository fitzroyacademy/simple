		<p>This lesson is about how to plan and create video lessons, focusing on the structuring and planning process. Creating good structure for a video lesson is the most important aspect to creating quality engaging video teaching.
In many ways it’s more important than your gear, your presentations or your editing skills. Nailing this means better teaching with less work. NB: This is not a list of hacks. You’ll probably still need to practice a bunch and make all the classics mistakes.

		<p>We’ll be starting with the VERY basics of your lean canvas. All you need to do is grab a pen, paper and post-it notes while Will takes you through some strategies to get your first canvas finished as fast as possible. Also, you’ll draw a few boxes.</p>

		<h2><span class="no">2</span> Solution.</h2>

		<p>Hold up, a little more work to do before we start filling out the canvas: We need to look at our customers, and our problem and dig into all the ways that combo exists. “It really sucks for [customer] when they experience [problem].</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">3</span> Steps.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="XO_cSktKaDA"></div>
		<p>Now it’s time to officially start your canvas. You’ll take your customer / problem sentence and run it through a few tests to make it stronger. Then take what you’ve written and fill out your first two boxes: the customer and problem box.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">4</span> Tips & mistakes.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="OP_mjxWwU1o"></div>
		<p>You’ve got a problem, and someone who has that problem, it’s time to start finding a solution to that problem. You break the problem down into a few parts and work out some solutions for each of these problems. This is where you might find your great idea only solves one of those problems and you have the joy of working a whole bunch of new solutions to research.</p>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">5</span> Feels.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="letoo21qHtY"></div>
		<p>We’re getting into the canvas now. its time to fill out the ‘Early adopters’ and ‘Channels’ boxes. As Will says ‘It’s working out who we’re going to hang out with for the next 3–5 years while building this business, and where to find them.’</p>

		<p>Revenue streams is all about working out your ‘rivers of gold.’ It’s important to work out a few different possible ways you can get income for your project. Often there is the first idea you came in with, but thinking through 2 or 3 alternate streams might help you identify some income you didn’t think was possible.</p>
