					<a href="https://http://thisisservicedesignthinking.com/">This is service design thinking.</a>

					<a href="https://http://thisisservicedesignthinking.com/">The Design Way.</a>
					<p>The Design Way is probably not the first book you should read when you’re exploring human-centred design as it’s quite heavy. However, it does put some vital focus on mindset, knowledge set, skill set and toolset in design. Furthermore it focuses on the integration of the design practice across your whole life. We recommend this book when you feel you’re ready to take the next step in learning more in depth about human-centred design..</p>
