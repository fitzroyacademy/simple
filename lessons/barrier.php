		<h2><span class="no">1</span> Part 1: Muso, part 1.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="8Deu9M09As0"></div>
		<p>This lesson is all about the power of deep reading on people’s personal stories. We start with hearing from Ari on his journey in Mali to develop the Barrier mapping process.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">2</span> Define your patient.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="vjgDmfPcQU8"></div>
		<p>The first real step in this process is to ‘define your patient.’ This is the person who will form the center of your map. The ‘patient’ will change greatly depending on your context; you might also say ‘user’ or ‘customer.’ It’s the person you care about, and are trying to help.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">3</span> Part 3: Muso, part 2.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="BPOqbvbN5xA"></div>
		<p>Back to Ari’s story with Muso.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">4</span> Interviews.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="2NmIwC6rcp0"></div>
		<p>Now that you have a definition of who you care about helping, it’s time to gather some interviews. This process can potentially be quite intense depending on who you’re working with, but regardless of who they are, Ari goes through the most important things to keep in mind when interviewing someone.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">5</span> Close reading.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="XPqFKmyshlA"></div>
		<p>Close reading is the process of diving deep into the text of what someone has told you. It’s more than just listening to someone, its really interrogating what they’ve told you. This is an expansive process where you try to keep an open mind to what barriers they could be telling you, rather than what you assume.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_bonus">
		<h2><span class="no"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></span> More close reading practice.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="8TdSBZHg8hA"></div>
		<p>For those who are keen on more close reading examples, Ari does another deep reading for a different interview subject.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">6</span> Creating a map.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="H7TPrftpFrI"></div>
		<p>Now that you have a whole bunch of ideas for potential barriers from your patients its time to start thinking about the map you’re creating.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">7</span> Muso, part 3.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="2W00ZFA3Mms"></div>
		<p>In the the final chapter of the Muso story, Ari explains how they used what they learnt from their barrier mapping in creating their interventions in Mali.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="segment segment_lesson">
		<h2><span class="no">8</span> Generating ideas.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="scUkklq0puc"></div>
		<p>Finally, with your created barrier map, its time for you to start generating ideas for your own interventions and solutions. The map is used as a jumping off point but ultimately it’s about seeing what works best for your patients.</p>
