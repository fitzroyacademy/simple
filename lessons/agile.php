		<div class="youtube" id="umWqry_jcpc"></div>
		<p>To start, Clare introduces us to the rituals associatoed with planning a good agile project. The prep work is required to make sure the rest of the project runs smoothly</p>
		<h3>Project scoping workshop.</h3>
		<p><b>Participants:</b> Include your entire project team.</p>
		<p><b>Time: </b> As long as it takes to properly scope the project.</p>
		<h3><p><b>Agenda: </b></p></h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by brainstorming all the possible projects that could be done to achieve your goals.</li>
				<li>Narrow down to find a project that is achievable.</li>
				<li>List all the things that need to be done in order to get the project finished and write them in a series of story cards: As a (user), I need (a thing) so I can (achieve a goal)</li>
				<li>Finally, take a guess at how big each task is relative to the others. Use ‘T-shirt sizing’ to label the tasks Small, Medium and Large.</li>

				<li>Decide on a week's worth of work: what’s important to be finished?</li>
				<li>Move those cards into the ‘doing this week column.’</li>
				<li>For each card, someone puts up their hand to be responsible for making sure this card is completed by the end of the week - the project owner. (NB: this person doesn’t actually have to DO the work, only insure that it’s done.)</li>
				<li>Finally, make sure everyone has a week’s worth of important work to be done.</li>
