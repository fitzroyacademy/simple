		<h2><span class="no">1</span> Story.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="wFMvikLISy0"></div>
		<p>We're going to start with the most important part of any presentation - The story. Maria takes you through a process to get your ideas out and find a compelling start and end to your story.</p>
		<h3>The activity</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Brainstorm.</li>
			<li>Distill into the important points.</li>
			<li>Create a story with beginning, middle, and end.</li>
			<li>The first and last sentences matter more than any other. Craft them. Memorize them.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The story should leave someone able to accurately share your idea with a friend and really want to.</li>
			<li>Less is more: You can always say more later; you can never say less. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2><span class="no">2</span> Visual slides.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="p1ncyFaj9wg"></div>
		<p>Now, this lesson is about performance, not pitch decks, however if you feel like you want some guidances on your slides, Maria shows you a structure and some thoughts on the visuals of a good slide deck.</p>
		<h3>The outline</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Crisp statement (a sentence or two) on who you are and what you do.</li>
			<li>Compelling presentation of the problem.</li>
			<li>Big picture view of your solution and how it works with vivid examples.</li>
			<li>What you’ve done so far (delivery numbers/early results)  and the meaningful impact.</li>
			<li>Vision of big possibilities and what you want the person in the audience to do next.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Don’t bury the headline: Don’t be more than a minute into the presentation before you’re talking about your specific solution.</li>
			<li>The slides may be cues, but they’re not your notes.</li>
			<li>Keep your slides to one idea/few words per slide, 24-point font or bigger.</li>
			<li>Use large, high quality images (one per slide, full frame)</li>
			<li>Make your graphs so simple a 5th grader could understand it.</li>
			<li>Remember people will forget almost everything you say, what’s the one thing you’d like them to remember?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><span class="no">3</span> Rehearsal.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="UMBbEe0uK-A"></div>
		<p>You've got your story and your slides  ready to go, is it time to start pitching? No, first we need to rehearse. and rehearse, rehearse and rehearse. Maria shows you a method to make sure you're rehearsals are productive, but unfortunately there's no escaping how embarressed you'll feel.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Make it look easy, make it look natural: that means rehearse, rehearse, rehearse (10x at least)!</li>
			<li>Record yourself presenting the idea.</li>
			<li>Be embarrassed.</li>
			<li>Work on the spots that trip you up consistently.</li>
			<li>Work on the transitions between ideas.</li>
			<li>Focus on your strong points - funny, warm quiet.</li>
			<li>Think about how fast you speak: Too fast and people won’t be able to keep up, too slow and people will drift off.</li>
			<li>Pick out jokes, ‘Ah-ha’ moments and learnings to focus on. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2><span class="no">5</span> Performing.</h2>
		<div class="youtube" id="wzQQLdTtdz4"></div>
		<p>Making a fool of yourself in public is everyone's biggest fear, but don't worry Maria shows you how to stay comfortable and give a strong performance, each and everytime with your amazing new presentation.</p>
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Own the stage. You’ve practiced and prepared, now you can be fully present in the moment on stage (or even in a meeting).</li>
			<li>Be mindful of your nerves. It’s ok to be nervous but stand up straight and don't look at the ground.</li>
			<li>Start strong, either introducing yourself or jumping straight in if you were introduced.</li>
			<li>As you go, get a sense of the audience. Pick a few people to focus on. Safety and connection.</li>
			<li>Modulate your voice. Go higher and lower, louder and softer.</li>
			<li>Emotional support. Keep going!</li>
		</ul>
