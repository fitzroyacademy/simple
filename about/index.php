			<p>Fitzroy Academy is a project created by <a href="https://willdayble.com" target="_blank">Will</a> Dayble and <a href="https://oilportraits.org/" target="_blank">Avraham</a> Vofsi along with many collaborators and partners.</p>
			<p>Through various iterations landed on this: An online repository of free lessons on design, business, digital and impact.</p>

			<p>The resources are free, made by and for social sector folks.</p>
			<p>Most lessons are 30 to 60 minutes of video, with templates and worksheets. Each should take you a few hours to do well. They work really well when done with a group of people.</p>

			<h3>However, what we do should be illegal.</h3>
			<p>In retrospect, we are a little embarrassed at how entrepreneurial we were at the beginning of all this whole online education shtick.</p>
			<p>It seems a big call to say it, but after we spending time in alt-ed, we are more and more convinced that alt-ed just shouldn't exist.</p>
			<p>In Finland, it's <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Finland-prohibit-the-establishment-of-private-schools" target="_blank">illegal to fund</a> private schools.</p>
			<p>There's nothing wrong with interesting alternative education models, tech, products, videos and ideas. But we need good education policy that ensures access and inclusion is universal. After being a part of the online education world, we think that <a href="https://medium.com/fitzroy-academy/learn-online-not-alone-671508b0dc79" target="_blank">the internet cannot democratise education</a>.</p>
			<p>Through Covid-19, families around the world have learnt that online can never replace great in person learning. We're appreciating our teachers more, but not enough.</p>
			<p>Globally, we are yet to make the necessary structural changes to how education fits within our society more broadly. We also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171219-the-hidden-judgements-holding-people-back" target="_blank">blame education</a> for problems it can never solve. It's impossible for any individual to 'self-teach' their way around poor policy decisions. The upstream issues can never be solved by downstream education.</p>
			<p>But there is hope.</p> 
			<p>Citizen-driven organisations are on the rise, and folks are realising that we can't entrepeneur our way past policy problems that have and will only ever be solved through collective action and power.</p>
			<p>If you're a teacher, thank you. If you're a grass roots organiser, double thank you. Together we can get it done. :)</p>

			<p><strong>Fast facts</strong> on our video production:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>It can take 100-200 hours of work to make a 30 minute lesson.</li>
			  <li>Our camera gear fits in one pelican case.</li>
			  <li>So far we've filmed in Melbourne, Sydney, London, Denpasar, San Francisco, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Puerto Galera.</li>
			  <li>We've produced 1300+ minutes of content, not counting the work we've helped others create. That's something like 6+ months of continuous learning if you used it weekly the way it&rsquo;s designed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Weirdly, we don&rsquo;t track minutes watched. We don't think it's a useful metric. But we know that many thousands of people have watched the work we've helped make ove the years, and that's quite satisfying.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.oilportraits.org/">Rami</a> does most of the heavy lifting on video, and the amazing <a href="https://www.filmsbyeve.com/" target="_blank">Eve Byers</a> (alumni, we miss you) created many of our videos. They're award winning film makers and artists in their own right.</p>

	<h3 class="green">The timeline so far...</h3>

	<dl class="fat_storyline">
		<dt>2012-ish</dt>
		<dd><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukegiuliani/" target="_blank">Luke</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willdayble/" target="_blank">Will</a> and Jules start a <a href="http://gracefitzroy.com/" target="_blank">cafe in Fitzroy</a>, and use the back few rooms as studio space for their <a href="https://squareweave.com.au" target="_blank">digital agency</a>.</dd>
		<dt>2013</dt>
		<dd>In the back meeting room of the studio, we run tiny courses for friends and colleagues after work hours. Students pay $5 per evening to one of our staff members who'd stick around after work to mentor and teach.</dd>
		<dt>2014</dt>
		<dd>Will gets <a href="https://medium.com/business-as-usual/the-moment-i-realised-university-doesnt-work-6352bc7be446" target="_blank">all worked up about universities</a>, and we launch the 'Fitzroy Academy of Getting Shit Done', an impact accelerator for non-techy people. We pilot a program with 25 students and 40 teachers + mentors at <a href="http://donkeywheelhouse.org/">Donkey Wheel house</a>. It's a roaring success.</dd>
		<dt>2015</dt>
		<dd>We do the numbers and realise that physical programs will be far too expensive for most of the folks we want to help, so we decide to play around with going completely online. We make <a href="/about/mistakes">many, many mistakes.</a></dd>
		<dt>2016</dt>
		<dd>The <a href="https://exchange.telstra.com.au/telstra-news/telstra-foundation/" target="_blank">Telstra Foundation</a> comes on board as our first serious partner, sponsoring 20 video lessons on digital and user experience for the non-profit sector. We start selling social entrepreneurship education on the internet.</dd>
		<dt>2017-18</dt>
		<dd>We film lessons with the <a href="https://mulagofoundation.org/" target="">Mulago Foundation</a> crew and their fellows on high impact systems change, which is <em>tremendously</em> exciting. Will starts teaching at Monash University.</dd>
		<dt>2019</dt>
		<dd>The <a href="https://www.firetree.org/" target="_blank">Firetree Trust</a> invite us to do work in South East Asia, which turns into child protection policy work with <a href="https://www.stairwayfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Stairway</a> in the Phillipines and women-led micro-enterprise with <a href="https://www.sheinvestments.com/" target="_blank">SHE Investments</a> in Cambodia.</dd>
		<dt>2020</dt>
		<dd>After 5 years, we <a href="https://medium.com/fitzroy-academy/learn-online-not-alone-671508b0dc79" target="_blank">give up on platform education</a>. COVID-19 hits. We start pouring more time and energy into our own online courses, building our own LMS tech and helping other organisations with blended learning. In the end, the collab work is the most effective.</dd>
		<dt>2021</dt>
		<dd>Well that was a shitshow, huh?</dd>
		<dt>2022+</dt>
		<dd>We have a better idea of where the gaps in blended, distributed learning are. We feel a big missing piece is in political activism and policy work, and the structures around how communities gather together to organise themselves around collective issues.</dd>
